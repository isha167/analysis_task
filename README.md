## Analysis for Gas Demand Models
An analysis on the data of the daily gas consumption that is provided by the industry, so it can be passed through for modelling of data to predict behaviours and see patterns.</br >


Following steps were taken for the analysis </br >
1. Reading the data into csv files </br >
2. Reading CSVs into panda dataframe  </br >
3. Cleaning the data by finding null and duplicates and dropping them if required  </br >
4. Finding outliers using boxplot and IQR  </br >
5. Finding correlation between various key indicators </br >
6. Supporting the findings with appropriate and relevant visualization </br > 
7. Reporting the findings and errors and limiations on the data

For this task following applications and libraries were used </br >
1. Jupyter Notebook  </br >
2. Pandas  </br >
3. Matplotlib  </br >
4. Seaborn  </br >
